**Project Title:** CanadianNewsSnippets

**Project Description:**
The CanadianNewsSnippets web app is a focused capstone project for a group of four students pursuing a diploma in Information Technology and Solutions, with a specific interest in web development. The project aims to develop a simplified news aggregator web application tailored to the Canadian market, to be completed within 12 weeks. The primary technologies and tools to be utilized are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, etc.

**Scope and Project Goals:**

1. **Canadian News Aggregator:** Create a web application that aggregates news articles from two reputable Canadian news sources (e.g., CBC and Global News), providing users with summarized news snippets.

2. **User Registration and Authentication:** Implement basic user registration and authentication mechanisms, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and personalize their news preferences.

3. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the web app is fully responsive and compatible with various devices, including desktops and smartphones.

4. **Intuitive User Interface:** Design a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to browse news snippets, customize their news feed, and access detailed articles.

5. **Summarization and Content Display:** Implement a basic summarization algorithm to generate concise news snippets from full-length articles. Display these snippets to users with links to the original articles. You can use generative AI models.

6. **Basic Commenting Feature:** Enable users to leave comments on news snippets. Comments will not require real-time updates or complex moderation.

7. **Backend Development:** Use Node.js to build a basic backend for user registration, news aggregation, and comment storage.

8. **Database Integration:** Employ a simple database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user data, news articles, and user interactions.

9. **Security and Privacy:** Implement basic security measures, including password hashing, to protect user data.

10. **GitHub for Version Control:** Use GitHub as the version control system for collaborative development. Create a repository for the project, set up branches for individual tasks, and regularly commit code changes. Follow best practices for branching, merging, and code review.

11. **Dockerization and Docker Compose:** Dockerize the frontend and backend components of the application. Create Dockerfiles and set up Docker Compose for orchestrating containers.

**Week 6-7: Frontend Development (News Snippet Display and Customization)**
- Develop the news snippet display section on the homepage.
- Implement basic customization options for users to select their preferred news categories.
- Continue committing code changes to GitHub.

**Week 8-9: Backend Development (News Aggregation and Summarization)**
- Integrate news sources (e.g., CBC and Global News) into the application.
- Implement a basic summarization algorithm to generate concise news snippets.
- Create API endpoints for news aggregation and summarization.
- Begin Dockerizing the backend.

**Week 10-11: Frontend Development (Commenting Feature)**
- Add the commenting feature to news snippets.
- Allow users to post and view comments on news articles.
- Continue UI improvements for an intuitive user experience.
- Regularly commit code changes to GitHub.

**Week 12: Testing, Deployment, and Security**
- Conduct thorough testing of the application, including functionality, security, and performance.
- Fix any identified bugs and optimize the application.
- Deploy the web application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku) to make it accessible to users.
- Implement basic security measures to protect user data (e.g., password hashing).
- Dockerize the frontend and backend components.
- Ensure GitHub repository is up to date.

**Week 13: Documentation, Final Testing, Docker Compose Integration, and Presentation**
- Create comprehensive documentation, including user guides and developer documentation.
- Perform final testing and quality assurance to ensure the application is ready for presentation.
- Ensure all code changes are committed to GitHub and that branches are merged as needed.
- Set up Docker Compose for orchestrating frontend and backend containers.
- Prepare a presentation summarizing the project's objectives, features, and development process.

Upon completing the "CanadianNewsSnippets" project as outlined in 3 months, students will have acquired a comprehensive skill set in web development and project management. They will have developed proficiency in both frontend and backend development, gaining expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. Through the implementation of user registration, authentication, and data management, students will have honed their skills in database integration and security practices. Moreover, they will have mastered version control using Git and GitHub, enabling them to collaborate effectively in a team environment. The project also introduces students to news aggregation and summarization techniques, providing practical experience in content curation. Additionally, by Dockerizing the application and utilizing Docker Compose, they will understand containerization concepts, which are increasingly relevant in modern web development. Through rigorous testing, bug fixing, and performance optimization, students will have acquired crucial quality assurance skills. Furthermore, the documentation and presentation aspects of the project enhance their communication and presentation abilities. Overall, this project equips students with a diverse skill set and practical experience that prepares them for a wide range of roles in the IT and web development industries while also enriching their portfolios with real-world project.
